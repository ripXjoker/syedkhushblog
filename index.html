                    <p>A dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. The content and purpose of dreams are not fully understood, though they have been a topic of scientific, philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history.</p>

                    <summary>Why do we cry at born?</summary>
                    <p>A baby's first cry is a crucial sign that their lungs are working. Before birth, babies get oxygen through the umbilical cord. Once born, they must breathe on their own. The cry helps to open up the lungs, expel amniotic fluid and mucus, and start the process of independent breathing.</p>

                    <summary>What exactly happens after death?</summary>
                    <p>This question is one of humanity's oldest and most profound mysteries, with answers varying widely across cultures, religions, philosophies, and scientific perspectives. From a purely biological standpoint, death involves the cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism. What happens beyond that is a matter of belief and speculation.</p>

                    <p>This delves into the realm of metaphysics and cosmology. Scientific explanations point to the Big Bang, the laws of physics, and evolutionary processes. Philosophical perspectives explore concepts of causality, determinism, and purpose. There's no single, universally accepted answer.</p>

                    <summary>What are goosebumps?</summary>
                    <p>Goosebumps, or piloerection, are a temporary local change in the skin from an LRE (local reflex Erection) state to normal. The reflex of piloerection in humans is the same as that of other mammals. It is caused by a contraction of miniature muscles that are attached to each hair (arrector pili muscles). This contraction causes the hair to stand on end whenever the body feels cold or experiences strong emotions, such as fear, pleasure, or awe.</p>

                    <p>Déjà vu is the feeling that one has lived through the present situation before. This French phrase translates literally as "already seen." While many theories exist, from neurological glitches to memory association, the exact cause is still debated among scientists.</p>

                    <summary>What is the butterfly effect?</summary>
                    <p>The butterfly effect is a concept that states that "small causes can have larger effects." Initially used in chaos theory regarding weather prediction, it metaphorically suggests that the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil could set off a tornado in Texas. It highlights the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in complex systems.</p>
